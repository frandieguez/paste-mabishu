## Installation

For the installation just need to ensure to acomplish the next steps, let's go:

	# Activate the XMPP agent to upload pastes from XMPP(Jabber) protocol

		Install the library xmpp4r
			git clone git://github.com/ln/xmpp4r.git xmpp4r
			cd xmpp4r
			rake gem:install
			sudo gem install xmpp4r-simple
		
		Next is configure the XMPP bot for this you will have to have a Jabber/Gmail account and tell the application to use this account, for this create the config file *xmpp-bot.yml* at the config directory like the next example:
		
		# config/config.yml
		development:
		  xmpp_username: your_account@jabber.tdl
		  xmpp_password: your_password

		test:
		  development

		production:
		 development
			
			
	
	
	#Install Ultraviolet for syntax highlighting
		
		This library needs onigumura so let's intall it:
		
			wget http://www.geocities.jp/kosako3/oniguruma/archive/onig-5.9.1.tar.gz
			tar zxvf onig-5.9.1.tar.gz 
			cd onig-5.9.1/
			./configure
			make
			sudo make install

		Finally, let's install Ultraviolet gem:
			
			sudo gem install ultraviolet

		If you have the next error:
		
			require 'uv'
			LoadError: libonig.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory - /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/oniguruma-1.1.0/lib/oregexp.so

				This message is a bit confusing. It means Ruby canâ€™t find libonig.so.2, not oregexp.so as you could believe.

				To fix this, check if the library has been linked:

				$ ldconfig -p|grep libonig

				If the library is not linked, add the path to the directory where the file is located to /etc/ld.so.conf:

				/usr/local/lib

				include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf

				Then run:

				$ ldconfig

				Another way of fixing this problem would be to tell the build script to install it to /usr/lib.
